The solution involves carefully considering the order and specificity of your selectors. One approach is to be explicit and avoid relying on cascading that might be affected by unexpected specificity interactions.

```css
/* bugSolution.css */
#myDiv {
  color: green;
}

#myDiv.container {
  color: purple;
}

#myDiv.container div {
  color: yellow;
}

.container div {
  color: red; /* This rule will be overridden by more specific selectors. */
}
div {
  color: blue; /* This rule will be overridden by more specific selectors. */
}
```

This revised CSS ensures that the styles are applied predictably based on the clearly defined selector precedence, eliminating unexpected cascading from the initial specificity conflict.
