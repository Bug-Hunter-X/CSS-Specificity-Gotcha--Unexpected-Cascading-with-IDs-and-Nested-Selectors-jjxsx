The following CSS code snippet exhibits an uncommon error related to the specificity of CSS selectors:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

.container div {
  color: red;
}

#myDiv {
  color: green;
}

#myDiv.container {
  color: purple; 
}

#myDiv.container div {
  color: yellow;
}
```

In this example, the `#myDiv.container` selector has a higher specificity than `.container div` because ID selectors have higher precedence than class selectors, so the purple color will be applied. However, `#myDiv.container div` selector is more specific than `#myDiv.container` due to the nested div.  The specificity rules might lead to unexpected cascading behavior when using ID selectors in combination with classes and nested elements.
